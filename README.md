# BOTete Project

BOTete is like a "family bot". It is used in specific servers, to assist me and my friends to have a pleasant time in Discord.
This project started as a way to study and improve my skills in condig, but grew to be a useful tool to assist daily needs in Discord.

## How To Use

>***NOTE:*** BOTete is built for discord.js v11 and will not work on discord.js v12 yet. I am upgrading the code soon, as will be madatory in October 2020.

I don't recommend you use this code if you are a beginner learner. There are a lot of tutorials on how to make discord bots, so I suggest you to learn it well before using this code, as you'd need to make many adjustments to get it working for your server, and this code is not very commented, so you will have to find out by your own what the code are doing.

This code is best used as an archive. Get the fragments you need, the ideas that you like and merge with your own code.
